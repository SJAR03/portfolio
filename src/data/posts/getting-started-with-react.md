# Getting Started with React in 2025

React continues to evolve and remains one of the most popular frontend frameworks. In this guide, we'll explore the latest features and best practices for React development.

## Why React?

React's component-based architecture makes building interactive UIs straightforward and maintainable. Here are some key benefits:

- **Reusable Components**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering through React's reconciliation algorithm
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive library of tools and packages
- **Strong Community**: Active community support and continuous development

## Setting Up Your Environment

To get started with React, you'll need Node.js `installed`. The easiest way to create a new React project is using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

> This is an example

## Modern React Features

### Hooks

Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. The most commonly used hooks include:

- **useState** for managing component state
- **useEffect** for side effects and lifecycle events
- **useContext** for consuming context values
- **useReducer** for complex state management

### Concurrent Features

React 18 introduced concurrent features that improve user experience:

- **Automatic Batching**: Multiple state updates are batched automatically
- **Transitions**: Mark updates as non-urgent to keep the UI responsive
- **Suspense**: Better loading states and code splitting

## Best Practices

1. **Component Organization**: Keep components small and focused
2. **State Management**: Use local state when possible, lift state up when necessary
3. **Performance**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback judiciously
4. **Accessibility**: Always consider accessibility in your components
